# FutureFound AI Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects ("Projects") managed by FutureFound AI ("We" or "Us"). This license is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of Us and our users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions

"**You**" (or "**Your**") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

"**Contribution**" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the Projects.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**In plain English**: You keep the copyright to your code, but you give us permission to use it in our Open Source projects AND our Commercial/Enterprise products without restriction.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.

## 4. You Represent That:

1.  The Contribution is Your original work.
2.  You are legally entitled to grant the rights set out in this Agreement.
3.  If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer.

## 5. No Other Rights

Users of the software are granted rights under the Project's license (e.g., AGPLv3), but You grant Us the rights in Section 2 so We can relicense the contribution if necessary (e.g., for an Enterprise edition).
