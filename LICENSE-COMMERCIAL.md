# FoundrySpec Commercial License Inquiry

© 2026 FutureFoundAI. All rights reserved.

## Why a Commercial License?

FoundrySpec is distributed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)** for the open-source community. The GPLv3 is a "copyleft" license, which means:
1. You can use, modify, and distribute the code freely.
2. If you distribute a derivative work or incorporate FoundrySpec into a larger system, you **must** also release your code under the GPLv3.

For many enterprises, the "share-alike" requirement of the GPLv3 is not compatible with proprietary product goals or internal legal policies.

## The Commercial Edition

FutureFoundAI offers a **Commercial License** that provides an "escape" from the GPL obligations. This allows you to:
- Integrate FoundrySpec into closed-source or proprietary systems.
- Distribute FoundrySpec as part of a commercial product without releasing your own source code.
- Receive professional support and maintenance guarantees.
- Benefit from legal indemnification.

Commercial licensing is available on a per-developer or enterprise-wide basis. Pricing is negotiable based on team size and usage requirements.
