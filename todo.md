# TODO

[x] The folder name init creates should be foundryspec folder by default but the argument collected should be the name of the project used in the config file
[x] All categories should be included in the config but commented out
[x] Add the dist folder to git ignore by default
[x] Add a feature to run a server to run the main dist index.html file, this can be achieved by altering the projects main package.json file
[x] foundryspec upgrade command to install the latest version of foundry spec that will not affect the projects config or the diagram files
