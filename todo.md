# TODO

Add css styling for journeys please.

Now for the comments system, when the user clicks outside the comment areas, it should automatically be hidden.

alright then now on the hub, navigation usually carry .mermaid on the breadcrumb, can we remove the .mermaid so only the name shows and also let us move it to under the header to the top right bottom just under the header so it can grow as much without disturbing the search bar and the mode togggle
