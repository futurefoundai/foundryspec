# TODO

The project should be fully initialized now with a project Id and the config should be saved in memory within foundryspec CLI and not in the project, so we need a database of design for each project now I guess right?

There is an already existing system in place whether greenfield or brownfield project so, Every project must start from the persona phase in discovery meaning the phases of system analysis and designed must be clearly defined and accounted for in the database of the CLI

We don't need to move to the foundryspec folder anymore to run foundryspec build

We need to make sure that the build process is fast and efficient, we can use caching to speed up the build process

Add a misc folder for all other kinds of documentations
