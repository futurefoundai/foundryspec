# FoundrySpec 🛠️

**The Documentation Engine for AI-Human Collaborative System Design.**

FoundrySpec is not just a documentation tool; it is a **Living Digital Twin** of your system's architectural intent. Designed for the era of AI-assisted engineering, FoundrySpec ensures that your documentation remains the **Single Source of Truth (SSoT)**—a centralized, authoritative reference point that both humans and AI Agents can trust to avoid data fragmentation and drift.

## 🚀 Why FoundrySpec?

In a world of rapid AI development, traditional documentation fails because it is **unstructured, ambiguous, and stale**. This leads to AI hallucinations, context fragmentation, and architectural decay.

FoundrySpec solves this by providing:

- 🤖 **AI-First Design:** Optimized for LLM context windows. Structured, machine-readable specifications (Mermaid + Markdown).
- 🗺️ **Discovery-First Workflow:** Mandates a "Discovery Phase" (Personas, Journeys, Requirements) before a single line of code is written.
- 🔗 **Zero-Question Traceability:** Link high-level requirements directly to code components using implementation markers.
- ⚡ **Zero-Config Auto-Discovery:** Automated category management and project-wide graph validation.
- 👀 **Hot-Reload Dev Experience:** Real-time feedback loop. Edit your diagrams and see changes instantly in the Documentation Hub.

## 🛠️ CLI Commands

FoundrySpec provides a comprehensive toolset for managing your documentation lifecycle:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `init` | Scaffold a new FoundrySpec documentation project. |
| `build` | Generate the static documentation hub with full graph validation. |
| `serve` | Locally serve the documentation hub with hot-reloading. |
| `add` | Add a new documentation category (e.g., `foundryspec add security`). |
| `changes` | Generate a report of recent spec changes and implementation tasks. |
| `deploy` | Scaffold GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GH Pages. |
| `pull` | Incorporate external specs from a Git repository. |
| `sync` | Synchronize all external specs from remote repositories. |
| `upgrade` | Update local project templates and workflows to the latest standards. |
| `help` | Display the AI Agent Guide or specific workflow instructions. |

## 🖋️ The Footnote Policy (Optional)

Footnotes are **not compulsory**. They are supplemental assets used only when a diagram node requires deeper prose or technical specification.
1. **Diagrams First:** All architectural nodes are defined in `.mermaid` files.
2. **Markdown as Supplement:** If you choose to add detail, `.md` files must reside in a `footnotes/` subdirectory.
3. **Strict Addressing:** A footnote's `id` must match a node ID in its parent directory's diagrams.

---

## 🔗 Implementation Markers

Bridge the gap between design and code. While the AI focuses on intent, the **FoundrySpec Build Engine** handles the heavy lifting of traceability validation. Add markers to your code to link it to the spec:

```typescript
/**
 * @foundryspec REQ_UserAuthentication
 */
export class AuthService { ... }
```

Run `foundryspec build` to validate that all code markers resolve to existing IDs in your documentation.

## 🤖 For AI Agents (Jules, Gemini, etc.)

FoundrySpec provides a **Structured Context Layer**. When working in a FoundrySpec-enabled repository:

1.  **Consult Discovery:** Understand the user's intent and personas.
2.  **Verify Traceability:** Check which requirements your task satisfies.
3.  **Align with Architecture:** Ensure your implementation matches the Boundary and Component diagrams.
4.  **Sync Design:** Use `foundryspec changes` to identify what parts of the code need updating after a design change.
