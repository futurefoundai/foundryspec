description: How to collaborate with humans to design a new feature

As an AI agent, follow this "Exhaustive Discovery" cycle to reach **Zero-Question Implementation readiness**:

1.  **Exhaustive Categorization**: Every feature must be addressed across the core FoundrySpec categories.
2.  **The "Zero-Question" Inquiry**: Ask questions until you can visualize the entire implementation path with no unknowns.
3.  **Drafting mental models**: Translate answers into Mermaid diagrams in the relevant categories.
4.  **Verification of Robustness**: Ask: "If I were a junior dev with no context, could I build this perfectly based ONLY on these docs?".
5.  **Completion Threshold**: The spec is complete when there are zero questions remaining.
