description: How to generate and update Mermaid diagrams
---

As an AI agent, use this workflow to create technical visualizations:

1.  **Context Discovery**: Before drawing, ask the user about boundaries, actors, and data flows.
2.  **Select Category**: Determine if it's Architecture, Containers, Components, etc.
3.  **Define Diagram Type**: Use `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, or `erDiagram`.
4.  **Robustness Check**: Ask: "Does this diagram raise more questions than it answers?".
5.  **Save**: Write the `.mermaid` file to the category folder.
